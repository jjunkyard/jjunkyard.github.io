subtitle: Why are we bringing the Droids alive?

We are working towards the goal of making autonomous collaborative robots the norm in space exploration, which will help us make the next leap of advancement from singular probes and rovers of the past, evolving the way we waltz through space!   

### Our Vision

Develop extraterrestrial mission control systems to allow a heterogeneous, multi-robot team to autonomously and collaboratively complete tasks critical for a lunar or martian in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) mission. 

### Our Mission

Design and develop software systems to allow a team of robots with different capabilities to fulfill the mission needs and requirements as defined by pre-set objectives like materials needed to be extracted and target areas that need to be explored for an ISRU mission.
