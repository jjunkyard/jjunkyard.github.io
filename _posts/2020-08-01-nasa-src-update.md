title: NASA SRC Update... <span>:cry:</span>
---

First things first, apologies for the silence on this blog here. It has not been easy for all of us since COVID-19 hit major cities worldwide and ended up spreading across the globe.

Our team is no different and the pandemic has affected all of us in ways we could not have imagined. 

We are today sadly announcing that we will no longer be pursuing the qualification round for the NASA SRC II. Along with constraints on our personal resources and time commitments, we have been challenged technically as well. 

However, this does not mean that we will be giving up on the mission that we set out with as a team. We have learned a great deal from participation in this challenge, and we plan to use that knowledge to contribute to the advancement of mankind in space. Stay tuned for updates...
