title: Why are the Jawas back?
---

Some of you might be wondering what is the point of all this, and why are we spending our time and energies on this project at all. After all space has only been in the reach of powerful governments and corporations backed by the ultra-rich, so what are we even trying to do here.

Well as a team our conviction is strong that the future of robots in space is a distributed, autonomous and collaborative one, and that a small team of dedicated people can be really effective in solving some issues that most of these space technology companies and agencies have been facing. And we are looking forward to working with them, since this is the ultimate question of the survival of our specie and the eternal questions that haunt us on the very basic level of consciousness. 

We as a team believe that in order for us humans to become multi-planetary space faring civilization, the power of robotic autonomous technologies need to be harnessed, and we simply would not be able to do everything on our own in the harsh environments of other planets such as Mars and our Moon. Robots would be our best bet in traversing through the difficulties that we will face on extraterrestrial bodies due to the physical limitations imposed on us by our biology and the forces of evolution. Hence, we are working towards the goal of making autonomous collaborative robots the norm in space exploration and the associated activities that will help us make the next leap from probes and rovers of the past.

Hence, looking forward we believe that through developing software systems for orchestrating various robotic missions on the Moon and Mars, are just a stepping stone towards our ultimate goal of ubiquitous space robotic technologies.
