This blog is going to serve an an official space for all our progress updates, announcements and work showcases going forward. We want to be able to connect to people who share the same vision for robotic technologies in space, and we are looking forward to interacting with all of you all over the globe.

Now time for some good news, we have officially been accepted as competitors in the NASA Space Robotics Challenge Phase II....wooot wooott :confetti_ball::tada::fireworks::confetti_ball::tada:. You can find more about the challenge and its goals [here](http://www.spaceroboticschallenge.com).

Our team is currently small but passionate about this vision and we are looking forward to learning from the experience of being part of the challenge, and we will make sure to keep you posted via this blog on the updates regarding the challenges that we face along the way and the things we discover in the process.
