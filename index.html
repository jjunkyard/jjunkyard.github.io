<h2 style="text-align:center;">We are a diverse team of tinkerers, engineers 
and hobbyists trying to tackle the problems and challenges associated 
with collaborative robotic systems in space.</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Our team briefly competed 
in the NASA Space Robotics Challenge Phase II which focused on finding 
solutions to allow a heterogeneous, multi-robot team to autonomously 
complete tasks envisioned for a lunar in-situ resource utilization 
(ISRU) mission.</h3>
